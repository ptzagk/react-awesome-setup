# React Awesome Setup

This is a setup I use myself to build new projects.
The goal is to actually update this project whenever I create a new project.

## Tech

This setup includes:

-   React
-   React router
-   Flow type checking
-   Using React HookStore for global state
-   Using react hooks for local state
-   Using react hooks for fetching mock data

## Still missing

-   Loading
-   Suspense

## Run it

```
git clone https://github.com/tonygustafsson/react-awesome-setup.git
cd react-awesome-setup
npm start
```
